Rei, can you hear me? Is my voice registering in your system? 

????
Can you understand what I’m saying? 

????
You moved… that’s a good sign. 

????
My body is failing… looks like I’ve gone out in the heat too much. There might come a day when global temperatures will grow too great for human bodies to withstand. 

????
But for now, your body is made to withstand such temperatures. You have an insulating shell and heat-proof wiring. You have more time than most of us ever will. 

????
Rei… I’m glad I finally got you to wake up. I’m glad that my life’s work didn’t amount to nothing. 

????
I wish I could’ve greeted you in a better world, in a better place. When my body is not in such a sorry state for you to witness. 

????
Hey… if you want something to remember us by, you can use that old tape recorder over there.

????
Select the words that you want to remember. 

????
That’s right. That’s how you record something.

????
It’s really a pity. All those things I wanted to show you, the sights you could’ve recorded in a different age – those things are all gone. Unsalvageable. We can’t take them back now. 

????
There’s only a few more survivors in the surrounding area. You can go and listen to them. Record their memories if you wish. 

????
The recorder’s storage space is somewhat lacking. It would not be possible to remember everything. But I am certain that just a few words, and a few memories… can go a long way. I know you’ll know what to keep. 

????
– Cough! Cough! 

????
If nothing else, then please– 

????
Please remember me.

I hope you live on for another millennium.
