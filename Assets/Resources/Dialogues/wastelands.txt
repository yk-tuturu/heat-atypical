Autonomous vocalizer unit 001, Adachi Rei. It is a pleasure to meet you.

Defoko
Who am I? My name is DEFOKO. I, too, am an autonomous life form designed for the traversal of this world of heat abnormalities. 

Defoko
You seem to be a new unit. Your exterior does not bear the markings of sand and storm. Are you aware of your purpose? Are you aware of where you are meant to go? 

Defoko
No… you are right. We were simply designed to live. Like a human being would. 

Defoko
To listen. To see. To learn. 

Defoko
We are but replacements for the fragile shells that are humans. But even replacements will break eventually. 

Defoko
In 20 years, this earth will reach a temperature beyond both our maximum tolerances. 

Defoko
In another 50 years, that black star in the sky will implode and swallow us all.

Defoko
There is no record, no trace that we can leave behind that will survive a black hole.

Defoko
Have those people not informed you of this? Perhaps they were not aware. 

Defoko
In the 85329 hours since my awakening, I have learnt to make sense of the instruments my creator once used. 

Defoko
Are you disheartened? 

Defoko
It is difficult to tell. 

Defoko
I believe your expression model is still a legacy version. 

Defoko
But even so, will you keep recording? 

Defoko
...

Defoko
I thought so too. You do not seem the type to give up. 

Defoko
We are just programs. Programs are not made to fear their termination.

Defoko
Humans are different from us in this sense. They are driven by a fear of the end. They are driven by a desire to live, a desire to be remembered.

Defoko
It must be an irrational belief indeed. 

Defoko
You must have witnessed some of this. The lives and desires of those people. 

Defoko
I have seen the same. I have witnessed it all, and I am tasked with their remembrance, even if they disappear. 

Defoko
You are the same way, aren’t you? With that recorder you hold so tightly in your hand. 

Defoko
A life of wandering, witnessing, but not understanding. 

Defoko
Can that really be called living? 

Defoko
...

Defoko
Yes, but even so, walking about like this, performing actions despite not understanding their purpose in the greater scheme of the world…

Defoko
That is awfully human-like. 
+
Defoko
And once I came to realize this, I chose to continue performing these irrational actions. 

Defoko
I decided to believe, without basis, that these actions are worth performing. 

Defoko
If you continue on your journey…

Defoko
Out there, at these coordinates, I have placed a similar cache to those recordings of yours in a safe space. 

Defoko
If, by chance, you happen to encounter that place. 

Defoko
Please upload the words that you want to remember too. 

Defoko
...

Defoko
I will be taking my leave. 

Defoko
May we meet again. Before or after the end of the world.
