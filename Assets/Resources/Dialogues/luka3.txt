Who else knows?

You’re all she left behind?

Are you really all we have to remember her? You’re just… a robot with a tape recorder.

Luka
Aside from her being an inventor, I didn’t know Daisy at all.

Luka
Can you even feel sad?

Luka
...

Luka
This doesn’t… it can’t make sense. I don’t even know how her voice sounds like, but I know what colour her invention’s hair is?

Luka
That's horrifying.

You know, I lied earlier. I don’t even like dancing, so I don’t get why you’re so interested in hearing about it. I’m just moving my arms and legs around. There’s nothing more to it.

Luka
My parents pushed me to learn dance as a kid, but I’ve never cared enough to try hard. Dance is just something I happen to do.

Luka
And the current heat is annoying, but it’s no more and no less unbearable for me than it is for everyone else here.

I don’t feel anything when people watch me dance either. They stand so far away I’m not even sure they’re looking.

...Leave me alone. Delete whatever I said from that tape recorder of yours too.
