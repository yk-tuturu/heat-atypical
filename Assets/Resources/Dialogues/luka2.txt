(There are a lot of people here, standing a little to the back as to clear out the centre.)


(Luka stands in the centre of the Dancehall.)


(The music starts and the audience quietens.)


(Luka flicks her wrist and fan, kicking her lower leg up.)


(She sweeps her arm around and tilts her torso along in a circular motion.)


(She jumps, one-legged, and turns.)


(The choreography is short and sweet. The music is probably less than three minutes long.)


(...For good reason, probably. Her skin is beaded with sweat as she bows.)

Luka
Thank you for coming, everyone!


(The crowd claps for her. They seem fond of her and her dancing.)


(People leave the dancehall. Luka makes eye contact with you and walks over.)

Luka
So! How did you find my moves? I’m not too shabby if I do say so myself!

Luka
It’d be a great honour if even an android like you had fun.

Luka
Ah, where’s Daisy, by the way?

Luka
I wanted to get to know her better.

Luka
Huh?

Luka
This was… how long ago?
