Ah! Could it be? I always heard of Daisy working on a robot – is that you? You’re really walking around town?

Luka
Oh dear, I’m so sorry for being so sudden! I got a little excited there. I’ve never seen a real-life android…

Luka
Right, I’m sorry for the rudeness. I should introduce myself first. I’m Luka. I dance for our little survivors’ camp, right here at this open Dancehall. It’s what I’ve been doing since I was a child. What about you–

Luka
Wait no, my apologies.

Luka 
…Come to think of it, maybe you already know what I do. I remember Daisy came to watch my last performance a few days ago. I never really saw her around, so I don’t know much about her. I would be glad if she liked it enough to tell you about it, though. 

Luka
You need to hear about my daily life?

Luka
Well, I’d be glad to be of assistance!

Luka
I think I have the same routine as any other living person around here, honestly. Wake up, eat, sleep… And dance, of course.

Luka
Choreographing, practising, and performing – each day needs to include at least one.

Luka
And I perform at least once a week. That’s basically a given at this point. Everyone knows that.

Luka
It’s nice to spin and move about… it’s like floating along the wind. I can lose myself in the choreography, the rituals of perfecting the movements. Repetition and improvement. With every performance I feel like I’m improving myself.

Luka
And it makes me happy to be of service to my audience. Everyone here has been so supportive of what I do. It makes me feel like I’m gaining a reputation.

Luka
Although ever since the temperatures rose, doing public performances has gotten harder. It’s too hot to do intense and long choreography, and I can’t make the audience stand for too long either. I have to be grateful they’re there in the first place.

Luka
But at least I spend less time warming up!

Luka
That’s about it for my day-to-day activities.

Luka

Luka
Oh, and before I forget, I’m holding my next performance soon. Please come watch! And bring Daisy too!
