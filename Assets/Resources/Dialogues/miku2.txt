Oh, you’re back.

Miku
Have you talked to the other people around here? Honestly, for our situation, they’re a hopeful bunch.

Just the other day, Luka put on a show for everyone at the Dancehall. She does that every week. She’s a ray of sunshine, and everyone admires her passion. There’s a real good chance you’ll find her at the Dancehall practising if you go there right now.

Miku
I think this week’s performance is coming up soon, so go check it out.

There’s also this old chemist you probably haven’t seen, since he’s always cooking in his basement. I ran into him yesterday and he asked me to try some white powder he made. The newest formulation, apparently. Don’t try it.

Miku
And there was this pair of young girls that came into my store to buy supplies. They’re planning to leave this town later today, and they asked me to be their guide out.

Miku
…Well, I’m here to do my job. It’s hard to say no to their bright faces, as much as I want to.

Miku
I’ve had my share of adventure and now they’ll have theirs. 

Miku
Still can’t bring myself to encourage them.

Miku
...

Miku
…I can’t cage a baby bird, I suppose.

Miku
At least, I hope that they both have the resolve to stick together till the end. Since they won’t have anyone else to rely on. 

Miku
Fear can really strain a relationship, you know? And despair can end it. You end up making stupid decisions.

Logically, the chance that you’ll return to safety if you turn back alone is tiny. It’s there, but it’s tiny. So if you’re headed to certain doom anyway, you should at least keep a friend by your side.

Miku
At least, that’s what I think.

Miku
...

Miku
Anyway, I think they’re here. They’re waiting for me to be done talking. There, behind the wall.

Miku
I’ll see you again later.

Miku
…By the way, I swear I’m older than I look.
