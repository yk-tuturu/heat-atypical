In a bit shorter than twenty years, the last human on the planet went extinct, leaving only the sentient robot models who roam the wasteland. 

ending
In another fifty, the black star consumes the solar system awhole, leaving not a single trace behind of the rocky planet. 

ending
But before that. 

ending
Buried underneath shifting layers of sand was a tape recorder. 

ending
If you were to play its last recording, you would hear the voices of the last living humans.

ending
The ordinaryness of it would strike you first. It’s informal and it’s imperfect. There are strangely long pauses interspersed in between. 

ending
You can’t tell if whoever was recording had forgotten to turn it off, or if these humans chose to spend their final droplets of time in moments of quiet contemplation. 

ending
Your attention then turns to what is said: sentences spoken out of context, words of those who lived under the black star and red sky. 

ending
It surprises you; despite everything, people lived on. 

ending
With no small amount of gratitude in their hearts they honoured and cherished and wished to be remembered and it just so happens, it seems, that despite everything, this tape recorder would do that for them.

ending
You would then, perhaps, join them, in their fragile hope, that when the black star swallows all, it tastes the saltiness of their tears and their thrumming existence.
