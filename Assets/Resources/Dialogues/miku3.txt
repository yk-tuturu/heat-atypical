…There was someone I left behind in the desert.

Miku
She didn’t deserve it.

Miku
We grew up together in a small village. When the first trees started to die, our whole community migrated to find land to sustain our crops.

Miku
We didn’t know the world was dying everywhere. The longer we travelled, the more desolate the land. And the temperature kept rising.

Miku
I felt like we’d just turned and walked off a cliff one day.

Miku
And then people started to split up. These people I grew up with – they fell through my fingers like sand.

Miku
She – she never left my side – really believed if everyone just stayed put, we could build something from scratch again. And when she committed to it, I saw red. I could come up with a lot to explain why.

Miku
Maybe it was because I hadn’t eaten that day, or that the sun’s rays burned my face.
-
Miku
I think it was the despair upon realising the sun had turned black.

Miku
And I betrayed her. I’ve never seen her since. But she’s still out there.

Miku
I shouldn’t have been able to find this place.

Miku
...

Miku
....

Miku
.....

Miku
......

Miku
…What am I saying. I feel so old.

Miku
You, do you understand what I feel?

Miku
No? That’s good.

Miku
Then no one heard that.

Miku
...

Miku
You’re asking why I don’t just go out and look for her?

Miku
…I have a job now. There’s no way I can go back out there for good.

Miku
People count on me now. Many have counted on me. I can’t throw away those memories just like that.

Miku
…And I like to think that I’m being absolved. I’m making it up to her by giving these young people the hope I never gave her.

Miku
Aren’t you the same?
