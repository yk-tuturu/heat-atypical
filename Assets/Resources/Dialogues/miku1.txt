Welcome to Ringo’s Supplies. How can I–

Miku
Oh? What are you?

Miku
...

Miku
I see, then where's Daisy? 

Miku
...

Miku
.. So in the end, that old shut-in never left her lab

Miku
You must be the apple of her eye then, for her to leave you behind.

Miku
I’m Miku, and this is the shop I run. It’s mostly supplies for people that want to go off and explore beyond our area. I do a guide service too, up to a certain point. 

Miku
I’ve seen a lot of people off. I sold them a haversack and a compass and walked them straight out of town.

Miku
Did you know: none of them ever came back alive?

Miku
…I didn’t know androids could sweat.

Miku
I was just scaring you. None of them came back because they never wanted to come back. If you ask me, I can’t imagine that world at all.

Miku
But they seem to know where they’re going.

Miku
Maybe they even survived. We had a lot of hope. 

Miku
It’s hard to blame them for leaving us behind though. I wouldn’t say this overheating rubbled mess of doom is an good place to live the rest of your life.

Miku
I can remember what came before it.

Miku
You’ve never seen the colour green, right?

Miku
Other than in my hair. A real green.

Miku
Now, trees are all barren. They’re just a large lumpy pillar. But their branches used to be full of green leaves. Food grew on those branches too, called fruits: apples, oranges, lemons… And there used to be huge bodies of water – clear water. And the sun used to be white.

Miku
It’s not like I’ve never been out in the desert before. I just can’t imagine that what lies beyond our view is anything but more desert.

Miku
The sand gets into your eye, you know.

Miku
So I don’t reckon you’re interested?

Miku
…That’s right. You should live the longest. We’ll all be fried before you take off that jacket.
