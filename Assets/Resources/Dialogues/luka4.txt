...Hi. You’re back again.

Luka
Tell me you didn’t tell anyone what I said.

Luka
...Alright.

Luka
What do you need from me now?

Luka
...

Luka
I don’t know. What am I supposed to feel right now?

Luka
I wish I were like you. Just a robot, simple and easy.

Luka
I need dance. But it’s not special to me. And neither is performing for people.

Luka
Dance is what connects me to everyone else. I remember my parents through dance. I remember our old world through dance. Everyone here in this town recognise me through dance.

Luka
I thought that was how it’d always be.

Luka
But I can’t stand the idea that people will think of me and only remember a passionate, sunny dancer and her fan.

Luka
Just like how people think of Daisy and only see you, now.

Luka
I want everyone to see me for a little more than that.

Luka
...

Luka
There’s a part of me that wants to return like nothing happened, and a part of me that wants to reject that. It’s like I’m two different people.

I think I need to make a choice soon, before the heat completely erodes my identity.
